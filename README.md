# üöá London Underground Name Fun Project: A Journey Through the Alphabet

[üëã Hello, Threads Community!](https://www.threads.net/@bowlofchalk/post/C-hKosIopxE) üéâ

Welcome to a quirky and fun exploration of London Underground station names! If you've ever pondered the oddities of station name letters‚Äîor wondered about *MACKEREL*‚Äîyou're in for a treat. Spoiler alert: **St John's Wood** is the only station on the Tube without any letters from *MACKEREL*. But there's so much more to uncover!

## üîé Station Name Collage

This project is about discovering fascinating patterns in the letters of station names. Here's what we found:

## üéâ Fun Facts

- **St John's Wood**: The only station without any letters from *MACKEREL*. But *REALLY* any word with the letters "ERAL" but without "ST JOHNWD" would work, like *REAL*.
- **Pimlico** & **Dollis Hill**: *NEAR* is enough to narrow down to only these two. Individually, Pimlico can be narrowed down with *RESTAURANT* and Dollis Hill with *ENTRANCE*.
- **Belsize Park**: The only station with a `Z`.
- **St James Park**, **Willesden Junction**, & **St John's Wood**: The only stations with a `J`.
- **Chigwell**: *TRANSPORT*
- **Bank**: *SHORT LIVED*
- **Amersham**: *CITY OF LONDON*

### üÖ∞Ô∏è Alphabet Heatmaps

- **Most Common Letters on Top:**
  Check out this heatmap to understand why *MACKEREL* works as a filter for **St John‚Äôs Wood**‚Äîstation names are sorted by how often each letter appears, grouping stations with the most common letters together.

- **Rare Letters On Top:**
  This heatmap shows stations with rare letters (like `Z` and `J`), putting them at the top.

## üß© Finding the Best Letter Filters

I have developed tools to help find the most interesting letter filters for London Underground station names.

This is accomplished using a highly efficient Python version, and there's also [an interactive web version](https://manglekuo.com/works/london-underground-name-analysis/name-lab).

A lot of effort went into making this extremely fast, with valuable assistance from ChatGPT. The main idea is to avoid unnecessary searches and use a binary bitmask to speed up the comparison.

### Running

1. **Use `test.py` if you are only interested in the best filter for each station:**
   - Edit the file to adjust the `target_stations` variable to the stations you want to analyse.
   - Run the following command to test and find the best filters for each station:
   ```zsh
   python test.py
   ```
   - This will provide filters for the target station name. These filters are letter combinations that **do not** share any letters with the target station name but share at least one letter with all other stations.
   - Additionally, it will output "narrowed down filters," which are letter combinations that narrow down the possibilities to a small group of stations, including the target station. By default, we are particularly interested in filters that are shorter than 4 letters and reduce the group size to less than 5 stations.

2. **Use `find_words.py` if you want to make your own puzzle:**
   - Edit the file to adjust the `target_stations` variable to the stations you want to analyse.
   - Run the following command to test and find the best filters and their corresponding English words for each station:
   ```zsh
   python find_words.py
   ```
   - This will run `combined_filter_finder` to get unique and narrowed-down filters for specified target stations.
   - Find the top 2 (configurable) most frequently used English words or phrases that match these filters.
   - Output the result as `final_output.json`.

### How does it work?

### `combined_filter_finder.py`

1. **What it does:**
   - Preprocesses the station names by sanitising and counting the frequency of each letter across all station names.
   - Converts each station name into a 26-bit binary representation, where each bit corresponds to an English alphabet letter's presence.
   - Utilises precomputed letter frequencies to prioritise and propose filters from the most probable to the least.
   - Tests each filter for both unique and narrowed-down criteria, recording and outputting the results.

2. **How to run:**
   - Edit the file to adjust the `target_stations` variable to the stations you want to analyse.
   ```zsh
   python combined_filter_finder.py
   ```

### `txt_to_binary.py`

1. **What it does:**
   - Reads an ordered list of words/phrases from `130k.txt`.
   - Converts each word/phrase into a 26-bit binary representation (one bit per English alphabet letter).
   - Encodes these binary masks into a Base64 format.
   - Outputs a single concatenated Base64 string into `base64.txt`, ensuring a super fast look-up in our `find_words.py` script.

2. **How to run:**
   ```zsh
   python txt_to_binary.py
   ```
   This will generate `base64.txt`, which contains the Base64-encoded binary representation of each word in `130k.txt`.

### `find_words.py`

1. **What it does:**
   - Loads the Base64 encoded data from `base64.txt` (if it doesn't exist, it prompts you to run `txt_to_binary.py`).
   - Runs `combined_filter_finder` to get unique and narrowed-down filters for specified target stations.
   - Finds the top 2 (configurable) most frequent words that match these filters.
   - Appends these words to the original JSON data and outputs the result.

2. **How to run:**
   ```zsh
   python find_words.py
   ```
   This generates a `final_output.json` file that includes the top words for each filter, helping to create new puzzles or insights.

### `conditional_filter_stations.py`

1. **What it does:**
   - Filters stations based on a given set of conditions.
   - Includes two filtering methods: 
     - Lists stations with names containing any or all of the specified letters.
     - Lists stations with names excluding any of the specified letters.

2. **How to run:**
   ```zsh
   python conditional_filter_stations.py
   ```
   Run with varied conditions to filter stations either by including or excluding specific letters.

### `test.py`

1. **What it does:**
   - Runs both `unique_filter_finder` and `combined_filter_finder`, `unique_filter_finder` only looks for unique filters.
   - A filter is a combination of letters that **does not** share any letters with the target station name but shares at least one with all other stations.
   - For example, for Bank it is "ELOR", meaning all other station names except for Bank have "E", "L", "O", "R". So, a word containing these 4 letters but no letters from "Bank" would make a good Mackerel puzzle.
   - Sometimes, if we can't find such a filter, we are interested in a filter that can at least narrow down to a small group. For example, a filter that narrows it down to a group of 2-3 stations.

   ```zsh
   python find_words.py
   ```
